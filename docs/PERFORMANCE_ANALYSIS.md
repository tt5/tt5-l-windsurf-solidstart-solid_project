# Map View Performance Analysis

## Current Implementation Overview

### Tile Management
- **Grid Size**: 15x15 (225 tiles)
- **Tile Dimensions**: 64x64 pixels
- **Viewport**: 800x600 pixels
- **Zoom Range**: 0.5x to 4.0x

## Performance Characteristics

### Strengths
- Lazy loading of tiles as they enter the viewport
- Batch processing of tile loads (2 at a time)
- Priority-based loading (center tiles first)
- Memory management for unused tiles
- Request throttling to prevent UI blocking

### Performance Metrics

| Metric | Current Value | Recommended | Status |
|--------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| DOM Nodes | ~1000+ | < 1500 | ✅ Good |
| Memory per Tile | ~50KB | < 100KB | ✅ Good |
| Concurrent Requests | 2 | 2-6 | ⚠️ Low |
| Batch Delay | 50ms | 50-100ms | ✅ Good |

## Optimization Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Virtual Scrolling**
   - Only render visible tiles + buffer
   - Potential 50-70% reduction in DOM nodes

2. **Progressive Loading**
   - Load low-res tiles first, then enhance
   - Consider WebP format for better compression

3. **Request Optimization**
   - Increase batch size to 4-6 for modern connections
   - Implement HTTP/2 multiplexing

### Medium Priority
1. **CSS Containment**
   - Add `contain: strict` to tile containers
   - Reduces layout recalculations

2. **Visibility Observer**
   - Replace scroll/resize events with IntersectionObserver
   - More efficient viewport detection

3. **Memory Management**
   - Implement LRU cache for tiles
   - Clear cached tiles beyond limit

## Device Performance Expectations

| Device Type | Performance | Notes |
|-------------|-------------|-------|
| High-End Desktop | Excellent | No issues expected |
| Mid-Range Laptop | Good | Minor stutter during fast scrolling |
| Mobile (Modern) | Fair | May need optimizations |
| Low-End Mobile | Poor | Needs significant optimization |

## Memory Usage Breakdown

| Component | Estimated Memory | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| DOM Nodes | ~2-5MB | Varies by browser |
| Tile Data | ~10MB | For 225 tiles |
| JavaScript Objects | ~1-2MB | State management |
| **Total** | **~13-18MB** | Without images |

## Implementation Notes

- Current implementation is stable for desktop use
- Mobile optimization recommended for better experience
- Monitoring memory usage is advised for long sessions

## Future Considerations

- WebGL rendering for better performance
- Service worker for offline support
- Performance monitoring integration
