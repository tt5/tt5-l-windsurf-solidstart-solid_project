## Tile Cleanup Implementation

### ✅ Currently Implemented

1. **Age-based Cleanup**
   - Tiles older than 30 seconds are automatically removed
   - Uses IndexedDB's timestamp index for efficient querying
   - Runs automatically every 10 seconds in the background

2. **Automatic Cleanup Scheduling**
   - Cleanup is scheduled on initialization
   - Each cleanup schedules the next one
   - Handles cleanup errors gracefully

3. **Database Management**
   - Uses IndexedDB for persistent storage
   - Implements proper transaction management
   - Handles database versioning and upgrades

### 🔄 Partially Implemented / To Be Improved

1. **Viewport-based Cleanup**
   - ❌ Not implemented: Cleanup based on distance from viewport
   - ❌ Not implemented: Tiles outside viewport + buffer are kept in memory

2. **Memory Management**
   - ❌ No limit on total number of tiles in memory
   - ❌ No cleanup of in-memory tiles, only database cleanup
   - ❌ No prioritization of visible tiles during cleanup

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - ❌ No viewport change debouncing
   - ❌ No batch processing for large cleanups
   - ❌ No progressive loading of tiles
