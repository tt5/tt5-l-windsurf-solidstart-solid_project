# Application Weak Points Analysis

## 1. Performance and Scalability
- **Inefficient Data Fetching**: Fetches base points on each move without proper batching
- **No WebSocket Implementation**: Uses HTTP polling which is inefficient for real-time updates

## 2. State Management
- **Excessive State in Board Component**: The Board component manages most of the application state
- **Potential Re-render Issues**: Some state updates might trigger unnecessary re-renders

## 3. Error Handling and Validation
- **Basic Error Handling**: Lacks comprehensive error boundaries
- **Incomplete Input Validation**: Some API endpoints lack robust validation

## 4. Code Organization
- **Tight Coupling**: Components are tightly coupled
- **Business Logic in Components**: Business logic should be separated
- **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling patterns

## 5. Testing
- **Limited Test Coverage**: Only basic utility functions are tested
- **No Integration Tests**: No tests for component interactions
- **No E2E Tests**: Critical user flows aren't tested

## 6. User Experience
- **No Loading States**: Missing loading indicators
- **No Optimistic Updates**: Could feel sluggish

## 7. Production Readiness
- **No Offline Support**: No offline functionality in production
- **No CSRF Protection**: Could be vulnerable to CSRF attacks in production
- **No Input Sanitization**: Potential for XSS attacks in production
- **No Rate Limiting**: No protection against API abuse or brute force attacks
- **Basic Authentication**: No rate limiting on login attempts in production
- **No Monitoring/Logging**: Limited observability in production
- **No Error Tracking**: No system to track and monitor errors in production
- **No Performance Metrics**: No way to measure application performance in production
- **No User Analytics**: No tracking of user behavior and engagement
- **No Database Backups**: Risk of data loss without regular backups

## 9. Infrastructure
- **Missing Database Indexes**: 
  - `base_points` table needs a composite index on `(x, y)` for spatial queries
  - `map_tiles` table could benefit from an index on `last_updated_ms` for cleanup operations
  - Consider adding an index on `base_points(created_at_ms)` for time-based queries
- **No Caching Layer**: No Redis or similar for frequently accessed data like map tiles (many users)

## 10. Code Quality
- **TypeScript Any Usage**: Reduces type safety
- **Inconsistent Error Messages**: Inconsistent error messages
- **Missing Documentation**: Limited documentation
