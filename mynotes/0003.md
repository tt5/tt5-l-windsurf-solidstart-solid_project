`What is my project?`

`Push changed files to github.`

`@docs:solid What are api routes?`

`Add a new api route.`

`Remove the test page.`

`After posting new items, get items does not return the updated items. Why?`

Quick Fix (for development only): Move the items array outside the module scope to make it persistent between requests:...

`Persist the items in a sqlite database instead.`

`Make an api route for deleting all items.`
